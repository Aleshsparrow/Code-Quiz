## About Project
    This project is all about bringing some enlightenment about the continent of Africa. Little is known about this beautiful continent in the diaspora, and the fact that CNN only airs UNICEF ads about hungry kids in Africa doesn't help matters at all. Yes, there are some regions that has been ravaged with different civil wars over the years and social unrest often lead to famine and famine leads to malnurishment, hence the UNICEF ads.

    The purpose of this quiz is to inform people about the beautiful continent and learn some fun facts about the continent, different from what has been portrayed on TV over the years.
